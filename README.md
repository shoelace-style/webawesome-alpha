# Web Awesome

Welcome to the [Web Awesome](https://webawesome.com/) alpha release for early backers.

First off, THANK YOU for supporting Web Awesome!

This repo serves as a place to collect bug reports and questions.

## Bug Reports

Please create an issue to submit a bug report. If the bug isn't obvious, please provide a _minimal reproduction_ so we can triage and fix things as quickly as possible. We're just a small team, so this _really_ helps us review and fix things for you much faster.

## Discussions

A great place to get help or ask a question is on the early alpha discussion board. Before asking a question, please take a moment to make sure it hasn't been answered already. The Web Awesome team will be notified about each discussion, so no need to ping us separately unless it's urgent!
